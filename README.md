Memory Game
===========

Simple application for teaching basic circuit design and microcontroller capabilities. Includes setup mode operation, and a memory game with coloured LEDs and audio output. 

Game Play
---------

**When the device is powered up (by connecting the battery), all four LEDs will blink in sequence and a two note melody will play.
**To enter gameplay mode, press the ‘S2’ switch on the microcontroller board.
**When the device enters gameplay mode, all four LEDs will blink in sequence and a six note melody will play.
**This will be immediately followed by a single blink of an LED, and a corresponding single note will be played.
**The object of the game is to copy the sequence using the corresponding buttons.
**If the sequence is copied correctly, the sequence will replay with the addition of a new LED flash and note.
**If you copy the sequence incorrectly, a low tone will play and the game will restart.
**You can replay your highscore at anytime by pressing the ‘S2’ switch while in gameplay mode.
**You can reset the entire device by pressing the ‘RESET’ switch or temporarily disconnecting the power source.
